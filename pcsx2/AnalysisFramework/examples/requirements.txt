# PCSX2 Enhanced Analysis Framework - Python Requirements
#
# Basic requirements for enhanced MCP client
# No external dependencies required for basic functionality

# Optional dependencies for enhanced features:

# For video processing and multimodal AI integration:
# opencv-python>=4.5.0        # Video capture and frame processing
# pillow>=8.0.0               # Image processing

# For AI service integration:
# anthropic>=0.3.0            # Claude API client
# google-generativeai>=0.3.0  # Gemini API client
# openai>=1.0.0               # OpenAI API client (GPT-4/GPT-4V)

# For advanced analysis:
# numpy>=1.20.0               # Numerical operations
# requests>=2.25.0            # HTTP requests for AI services
# asyncio                     # Already part of Python 3.7+

# Installation instructions:
#
# Basic usage (no external dependencies):
#   No installation required - uses only Python standard library
#
# Enhanced features with video processing:
#   pip install opencv-python pillow
#
# AI integration:
#   pip install anthropic google-generativeai openai
#
# Full feature set:
#   pip install opencv-python pillow anthropic google-generativeai openai numpy requests
#
# Note: The framework is designed to work without any external dependencies
# for basic functionality. Enhanced features require optional packages.
